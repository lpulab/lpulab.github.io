# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-users" %}Team

The Language Processing and Usage lab is a diverse group interested in how language is used from different perspectives, and in the application of quantitative methods in our research.
Each of us brings unique perspectives to this broad topic based on our own interests: syntax, semantics, pragmatics, language learning, literature, etc.
